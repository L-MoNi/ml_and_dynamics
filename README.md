# ml_and_dynamics

This repository contains code to explore NeuralODEs for timeseries data from dynamical systems as well as simple classification tasks. The models are written in [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and using [Diffrax](https://docs.kidger.site/diffrax/), [Equinox](https://docs.kidger.site/equinox/), and [Optax](https://optax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

 It builds on ideas from Patrick Kidgers [tutorial](https://docs.kidger.site/diffrax/examples/neural_ode/) on NeuralODEs using Diffrax and Equinox as well as the UvA DL Notebook on [Dynamical Systems and Neural ODEs](https://uvadlc-notebooks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_notebooks/DL2/Dynamical_systems/dynamical_systems_neural_odes.html#) in [Torchdiffeq](https://github.com/rtqichen/torchdiffeq).
